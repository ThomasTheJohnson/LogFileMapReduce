Command
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
hadoop jar lastrequest.jar stubs.ProcessLogs weblog <output directory>

The above command line command will run my Hadoop Job. The jar name is as listed lastrequest.jar, the driver class is named
ProcessLogs but it is contained in the package stubs so it must be called with the package name. The input information
comes from the weblog directory we uploaded earlier in the semester but the name of the output directory is up to you.

Hope your day is well!
